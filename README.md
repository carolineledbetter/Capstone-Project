# Capstone Project  
This repository contains everything except data for my capstone project for the Colorado School of Public Health (MPH). 

This project is using data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES) to explore the relationship between food insecurity and metabolic health.  
More information on NHANES can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/. 

The R project file is included so a new project does not need to be created on every machine.
